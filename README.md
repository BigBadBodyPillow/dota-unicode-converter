### Why did i find the nead to create this?
currently there is a list of dota emojis(https://github.com/s3rbug/dota2_emojis_unicode/blob/main/emojis.txt)
however it was last updated 2 years ago, there are many emojis not on that list.
There is also a way to get an updated list of emojis (https://github.com/blukai/dota2-emoticons/tree/master)
however that provides the unicode.
